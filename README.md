## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

**Helsinki Bus Tracker** is a comprehensive service designed to capture real-time telemetry data from the MQTT server, mqtt.hsl.fi. This service not only gathers telemetry data but also stores it for future use, making it easily accessible via a user-friendly API. Its primary focus is to provide up-to-date information about bus locations, upcoming stops, and more, specifically for the bus network in the region of Helsinki. It also includes a cleanup program that manages database memory. This feature can be particularly useful when the intended use of this program is for a short or long duration, allowing you to set up a time management schedule for cleaning up the database.    

**Purpose:** This project was created to help commuters, travelers, and developers access up-to-date information about bus routes and schedules in the greater Helsinki. My goal is to provide an easy-to-use and reliable source of data for a better public transportation experience. If desired, I also aim to develop a frontend for this backend service, creating a full-stack application that can be widely utilized.  

**Key Benefits:** With Helsinki Transit Tracker, users can quickly find information about buses near their location, search for buses based on specific locations in greater Helsinki, using their city and street names within a specified radius, check the every record stored of a bus by their vehicle number, retrieve current location, route number, destination, operator, status, arrival time to the next stop, and more for every bus that is currently in active status in Helsinki.  

**Audience:** This project is designed for public transportation enthusiasts, developers, and anyone looking to streamline their bus travel experience in Helsinki region.  

**License:** This project is open-source and available under the [CC BY-NC](LICENSE), with restriction on commercial use.  

**Contributing:** If you'd like to get involved, please refer to my website and contact me: [ahmettu.com](https://www.ahmettu.com) 

**Status:** Helsinki Bus Tracker is actively maintained and continuously updated to provide the latest and most accurate bus telemetry data.  


## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To run the application, you can use Docker Compose, which simplifies the setup process (as shown in Method 1). To do that, you will need to have [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed and set up.

### Method 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended, Easiest Way) <a name="method-1"></a>

#### Requirements:

Docker Compose:  
- Installation: Download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system from [Docker Desktop Installation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

#### Building the Application <a name="building"></a>

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:  

       git clone https://github.com/ahmetugsuz/Helsinki_Bus_Tracker

2. Change (if you're not in this directory already) to the project's directory:   

       cd Helsinki_Bus_Tracker  

3. Make sure the `docker-compose.yml` file is present in the project's root directory, and
    that you have Docker Desktop installed on your machine.

#### Running the Application

4. Running the application:  

       docker-compose build

5. Run the following command to start the application using Docker Compose:  

       docker-compose up  

6. Access the API at http://localhost:5001/{API-endpoint} and interact with it as described in the [Usage](#usage) section.  

7. To stop the application, press:
    - `Ctrl+C` in the terminal  
    or   
    - run the following command: `docker-compose down` in a separate terminal window.

Running `docker-compose down` will not only stop the application but also remove the associated Docker images. If you wish to restart the application, you'll need to rebuild it with the following instructions in part 4.  

Additionally, you can also use the Ctrl+C keyboard shortcut to stop the running Docker containers, and if you wish to remove the associated Docker images, you can type `docker-compose down`.  

To delete stored data from the database, first do a `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose down -v`. Be careful, as this will remove all data who has been stored until now from your database.  

These steps allow you to easily start, stop and delete the entire application, including all the required services, using Docker Compose.


### Method 2: Running Docker commands manually <a name="method-2"></a>

#### Requirements

Docker:  
- **Installation:** Download and install Docker (Engine) for your operating system from [Docker Engine Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Docker Engine is core component of Docker that allows to build, run, manage container. To be able to pull container images from Docker Hub, you need to have the Docker Engine installed.   
***Note:*** Docker Desktop is a comprehensive package that includes the Docker Engine. If you've already installed Docker Desktop, you have the Docker Engine installed and ready to use.

1. **Pull the database image** from Docker Hub by typing the following command in your terminal to download the image:    

       docker pull ahmettugsuz/all_bus_routes_finland:db-v2.0    

2. Pull the application image:  

       docker pull ahmettugsuz/all_bus_routes_finland:app-v2.0   
       
3. Pull the cleanup image:  

       docker pull ahmettugsuz/all_bus_routes_finland:cleanup-v1.0   

    **helping hints #1:** just cpy/pull all of them at once; run this cmd in the terminal:   

        docker pull ahmettugsuz/all_bus_routes_finland:db-v2.0
        docker pull ahmettugsuz/all_bus_routes_finland:app-v2.0

       docker rm bus_routes_cleanup  
       docker rm bus_routes_db       


## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the API endpoints by navigating to http://localhost:5001 and appending the desired endpoint to the URL. Alternatively, click on the endpoints listed below.   
**Note:** By default, the API limits the response to the latest 300 updates for each endpoint to ensure efficient data retrieval. However, you can adjust this limitation if needed. Additionally, the data is periodically cleaned up by a cleanup application, and you can configure the cleanup interval based on your usage preferences, from [cleanup configuration](#configuration). For development testing or real-life use, the cleanup interval and data limitation can be customized according to your requirements.   
The following endpoints are available:   

***Hint!*** When the application is running, come back here and make use of the API-endpoint links below by clicking on them, as long as they are not marked with `{}`. If they are, it means a paramter that you need to set a value for, either a place name or a number.

                    "destination": "Paloheinä"
                },
                "next_stop": {
                    "name": "Linnankoskenkatu",
                    "address": "25, Topeliuksenkatu, Eläintarha",
                    "lat_long": "60.18484, 24.917"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
    ```  

    ***Note:*** Replace the `street`, `city`, and `radius` values in the URL with your desired location and radius parameters.  
    ***Remember:***  A higher radius targets a larger area around the address provided in the URL. It is worth noticing that there might be "no bus found" within a radius of 500 meters (is it is only collecting buses with active status within given area/radius). This could be due to the cleanup application removing stored data to free up memory, or there might be no active buses in that area at that moment. Hence, consider increasing the radius or refreshing with the same parameters after a minute or so.

- **[POST] /buses_near_me**  

    This endpoint is designed for frontend use and allows users to request bus information near a specified location.
    It operates as a POST method to enable the frontend to send location data to the backend and receive bus data in response.

    **Input Parameters:**   
  
    - `location:` A JSON object containing information about the user's location, including street and city names (e.g., "street": "Turunväylä",  "city": "Vehkamäki"). 
    - `radius:` The radius (in meters) within which to search for buses near the provided location.  

    **Example Request (request body):**
    ```json
    POST /buses_near_me
    {
        "location": {
            "street": "Turunväylä",
            "city": "Vehkamäki"
        },
        "radius": 150
    }
    ```  

    **Example response from the backend to the frontend on request:**  
    ```json
    [
        {
            "vehicle_number": 1053,

### Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

#### Database Architecture <a name="database-architecture"></a>

This section provides an overview of the database architecture utilized in the Helsinki Bus Tracker application. The application relies on MySQL as the database management system to store and manage data related to bus stops, buses, real-time telemetry, and associated events.  
Below, you'll find details on the tables used in the MySQL database and their respective fields, outlining the structure and pupose of each table's columns: 

##### `stop_event` Table

- This table stores information about stop events, including status and arrival times.
- **Fields:**
   - `id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each stop event.
   - `status`: Textual information about the stop event status.
   - `arrival_time_to_the_stop`: The estimated arrival time for the bus at the stop.

##### `stop` Table

- The `stop` table captures data related to bus stops, their locations, and associated stop events.
- **Fields:**
   - `id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each bus stop.
   - `tsi`: A numerical timestamp indicating the time of the stop event.
   - `stop_event`: A foreign key reference to the associated stop event.
   - `stop_name`: The name or identifier of the bus stop.
   - `latitude` and `longitude`: Geographical coordinates of the bus stop's location.

##### `bus` Table

- This table provides information about buses, including their unique vehicle numbers and operators.
- **Fields:**
   - `vehicle_number` (Primary Key): The unique key used to identify each bus.
   - `operator`: The operator responsible for the bus.

##### `bus_status` Table

- The `bus_status` table serves as the primary data repository for real-time telemetry of active buses.
- **Fields:**
   - `id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each telemetry data entry.
   - `vehicle_number`: A reference to the specific bus via its vehicle number.
   - `tsi`: A numerical timestamp associated with the telemetry data.
   - `utc_timestamp`: The Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) timestamp for data recording.
   - `route_number`: The bus route number.
   - `current_location`: The current location of the bus.
   - `latitude` and `longitude`: Geographical coordinates of the bus's position.

### Cleanup Application <a name="cleanup-application"></a>

The Cleanup Application is an essential component of the Helsinki Bus Tracker system, designed to cater to developer needs. Its primary role is to maintain the database, ensuring optimal performance and data freshness. This component was developed with specific goals in mind:

- **Database Maintenance**: The continuous data accumulation from buses across Helsinki region necessitates regular database maintenance. The Cleanup Application is responsible for the scheduled purging of outdated data, preventing the database from becoming unwieldy.

- **Developer Focus**: Helsinki Bus Tracker primarily targets developers interested in exploring and understanding real-time bus telemetry data. For this developer-focused environment, historical data may not be necessary, making the Cleanup Application a valuable asset.


#### Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>

The Cleanup Application is set to perform cleanup every 6 minutes by default, ensuring that the database remains up-to-date without retaining outdated information. However, the cleanup interval is configurable to meet specific requirements.

To customize the Cleanup Application's cleanup interval (e.g., every 24 hours to perform daily cleanup, clearing data from the previous day), follow these steps:

1. Open the Cleanup Application's configuration file (`cleanup.py`).  

2. Locate the setting (variable inside the code) for the cleanup interval.  

3. Adjust the interval (variable value: `timesheduler`) to the desired value in seconds (e.g., 24 hours = **86400** seconds or 1 hour = **3600** seconds).  

4. Save the configuration file.  

5. Rebuild the application as described in the [Building the Application](#getting-started) section. If you don't want to rebuild the entire application (which might lead to missing some data), consider building only the `cleanup.py` component.

By extending the cleanup interval, you can retain bus telemetry data for a full day or even weeks/months, accommodating scenarios where historical data is more relevant.

This adaptability allows you to strike a balance between maintaining an up-to-the-minute database for development purposes and preserving data for longer durations when needed.  


### MQTT Telemetry Data Subscription <a name="mqtt-telemetry-data-subscription"></a>

The **MQTT-Subscriber** class in the Helsinki Bus Tracker project plays a critical role in fetching real-time bus telemetry data. It does this by subscribing to specific MQTT topics and collecting data from buses operating throughout Helsinki region.

#### Data Sources

MQTT-Subscriber class listens to the following MQTT topics:

```python
# Topic we want to subscribe to
topic = "/hfp/v2/journey/ongoing/+/bus/+/+/+/+/+/+/+/2/#"
```
  
These topics provide us with essential data such as vehicle identifiers, geographical coordinates, next stop, locations, status, and more.

#### Data Processing

When telemetry messages arrive, they are processed and efficiently stored in our **MySQL** database. This data includes information like GPS coordinates, destination, route number, utc timestamp, next stop, forming the foundation of our real-time service.

#### MQTT message subscription 

- We process messages from the MQTT server, `mqtt.hsl.fi`, in JSON-V2 format by subscribing to `v2`.
- We focus on ongoing bus journeys and use a geohash level of 2 for location accuracy, which prevents an excessive number of signals. This approach is particularly suitable for the current deployment phase, serving developers rather than end-users.
- We only gather signals from buses, and no other vehicles. 


This approach ensures that our users have access to the latest and accurate information about bus locations and more.

To learn more about MQTT subscriptions you can refer to the [official documentation](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/vehicle-positions/digitransit-mqtt/) provided by the service.

### Error Handling and Data Resilience <a name="error-handling"></a>

#### Continuous Data Updates

The **Helsinki Bus Tracker** service is designed to ensure the continuous consumption of telemetry data, even in the presence of error messages or application issues. This resilient approach guarantees that data updates are consistently processed, providing ongoing access to reliable and real-time information. If you encounter an error on one of the API endpoints, try the following steps:

1. Refresh the page to verify if the data is still updating.  

2. Attempt other API endpoints to cross-check.  

3. If data is not updating, check the terminal for any critical issues.  

4. If necessary, restart the service.  

#### Resolving Data Disruptions

In case you notice any disruptions in data updates, you have the flexibility to manually restart the application or application image (`app.py`) while keeping the database operational. This robust error-handling mechanism ensures uninterrupted data acquisition, contributing to a reliable and responsive service.

This feature allows you to maintain the flow of information and data integrity, even when troubleshooting or addressing application errors. It offers a seamless user experience and reliability in accessing up-to-the-minute bus data across greater Helsingfors.

Please note that due to the geocode policy, inactivity or long periods of inactivity may lead to a TimeoutError in the app. If this occurs, you can resolve it by simply restarting the 'app.py' script. To prevent such errors, consider sending periodic requests to the geocode service or stopping the application when it's not actively in use, ensuring a smoother and more reliable user experience.
